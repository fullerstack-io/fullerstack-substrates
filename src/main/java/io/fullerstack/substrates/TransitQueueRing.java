/// cascade pattern. Each emission is held as a (receiver, value) pair across
/// two parallel arrays indexed by `head & mask` / `tail & mask`. Capacity is
/// unbounded — when the ring fills, it doubles in size with a one-shot copy.
///
/// Per-iteration cost on the cascade hot path:
/// - enqueue: `int i = tail & mask; receivers[i] = r; values[i] = v; tail++`
/// - dequeue: `int i = head & mask; r = receivers[i]; v = values[i];`
///            `receivers[i] = null; values[i] = null; head++; r.accept(v)`
///
/// No chunk-advance check, no ring-reset branch, no linked-list `next`
/// pointer maintenance. Just `& mask` and indexed array access.
///
/// Single-thread ownership: only the circuit worker thread enqueues and
/// drains. No memory barriers, no atomics.
